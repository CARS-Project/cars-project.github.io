# Data sources

The [project team](team.md) will develop and link data sources focused on the usage patterns of all light duty vehicles (under 3.5 tonnes) in Great Britain, to create a single de-identified, research-ready dataset.

This dataset will be comprised of: 

- **MOT data** which includes the make, model, age and odometer reading of every vehicle taking a road worthiness test in Great Britain
